                        My name is Meredith Onions, and I am a junior studying informatics at the University of Iowa with a double minor in computer science and sociology. 
                        This means that I am obtaining relevant skills in data analysis and computing as well as usability principles and graphic design. I am also deepening 
                        my algorithmic knowledge and I am developing a strong understanding of society, injustices, and group behavior.

                    <p1 style="font-size: 16pt; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 30px;">
                        Outside of school, I work as an academic research assistant within a university lab that is primarily focused on human-computer interaction and tech for social good. 
                        I also serve as a lead volunteer at the university’s food pantry. Throughout the school year, I design lights for the university’s theatre department as well, 
                        which allows me to effectively combine my creative and technical skills.

                        I am very interested in careers related to web development, data analysis, and/or project management. I want to innovate and solve problems in the world of technology, 
                        and I want to make the world a better place in doing so. I developed this website myself to present a little more about me and my work.

                    My name is Meredith Onions, and I am a junior studying informatics - which can be defined as computer science from more of a usability standpoint - at 
                    the University of Iowa. I love to learn, and I am very passionate about academics. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection between art and 
                    technology; I absolutely love to code and think through logical problems, and I also greatly enjoy visual design.

                    My goal is to have a career that involves innovating and solving problems in the world of technology. I am proficient in many programming languages such as 
                    Java and Python. As a part of my major, I have learned a lot about programming and HCI, and as a computer science minor, I have taken coursework such as 
                    Discrete Structures, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I developed this website myself to present a little more about me and my work.
